          <h2>Hello!</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Kenneth Guillont, a soon-to-be graduate from Hunter College, where I am pursuing a B.A. 
            in Computer Science with a concentration in Bioinformatics and a minor in Mathematics. 
            I am eager to start my career in the field of data science, where I can leverage my technical skills 
            and passion for data to make a meaningful impact. <br><br>
            
            In my role as a Support Technician Intern at the Mayorâ€™s Office of Information Services, 
            I provided top-tier customer service by resolving technical issues across multiple departments 
            and restoring functionality for over 100 workstations during the recent global Crowdstrike outage. My experience as an HPC System Administrator 
            Intern at Weill Cornell involved collaborating with vendors and internal teams to enhance system performance and reliability, 
            ensuring seamless operation in high-performance computing environments. <br><br>

            Throughout my journey, I've explored different sectors in technology. At PwC, I had the privilege of working with Perkins School for the Blind, 
            helping roll out a new online platform aimed at certifying instructors on how to effectively teach blind and low-vision students. 
            This experience not only opened my eyes to the power of technology for social good but also reinforced my commitment to creating inclusive solutions. <br><br>
            
            As I prepare for graduation, I am furthering my data science skills through the CUNY Tech Prep program. 
            I am also excited to collaborate with a team to develop a computer vision system that translates American Sign Language (ASL) into text, 
            bridging communication gaps and enhancing accessibility. <br><br>
            
            I look forward to exploring opportunities in data science where I can continue to grow and contribute to impactful projects. <br><br>
